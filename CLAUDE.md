# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Telegram ChatOps bot for Kubernetes diagnosis. Receives Alertmanager webhooks or manual `/check`/`/scan` commands, runs deterministic playbook-based scoring (CrashLoop, Pending, Rollout regression), and optionally summarizes with an LLM. Returns structured results with inline action buttons in Telegram.

## Commands

```bash
make build          # build binary to bin/lazy-diagnose-k8s
make run            # go run ./cmd/bot
make test           # go test ./... -v
make lint           # golangci-lint run ./...
make docker-load    # build image + load into kind cluster "lazy-diag"
make scenarios      # deploy 9 test failure scenarios to kind
make scenarios-status  # check pod status vs expected
make demo-alerts NUM=3 # fire test alert webhooks
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test ./internal/diagnosis/ -v -run TestEngineName
```

## Architecture

Entry point: `cmd/bot/main.go` — wires all components and starts Telegram polling + webhook HTTP server.

**Request flow:**
```
Alert/Command → Intent Classifier (domain) → Target Resolver → Provider (collect evidence)
             → Playbook Engine (score hypotheses) → Diagnosis Engine (analyze + optional LLM) → Telegram response
```

**Key packages under `internal/`:**

- **adapter/telegram/** — Telegram bot integration: command handling, callback buttons, message formatting, alert notifications. `bot.go` is the main bot struct, `callbacks.go` handles inline button presses, `alerts.go` formats alert messages.
- **webhook/** — HTTP server receiving Alertmanager webhooks. Parses alert payload, extracts K8s target, calls bot's `HandleAlert`.
- **domain/** — Core types (`Evidence`, `DiagnosisResult`, `Target`) and intent classifier that parses user commands into structured intents.
- **resolver/** — Resolves fuzzy target names to actual K8s resources via pod search. No service map — uses fuzzy matching directly.
- **provider/** — Data collection layer. `Collector` aggregates sub-providers:
  - `kubernetes/` — K8s API client (pod status, events, deployments, replicasets). Also has `scanner.go` for namespace-wide unhealthy pod scanning.
  - `metrics/` — VictoriaMetrics queries (restart rates, resource usage).
  - `logs/` — VictoriaLogs queries (container log retrieval).
  - `mock.go` — Mock provider for tests.
- **playbook/** — Orchestrates evidence collection and delegates to the diagnosis engine. Selects which playbook (CrashLoop/Pending/Rollout) based on pod state.
- **diagnosis/** — Core analysis: `analyzer.go` scores hypotheses against evidence using weighted signal matching, `engine.go` coordinates analysis flow, `summarizer.go` wraps LLM backends (Ollama/Gemini/OpenRouter/OpenAI/custom), `redact.go` strips secrets from output.
- **composer/** — Generates suggested kubectl commands based on diagnosis results.
- **config/** — YAML config loading. Config at `configs/config.yaml`, env vars override config values.

## Configuration

Config file: `configs/config.yaml`. Key env var overrides: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (required), `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `VICTORIA_METRICS_URL`, `VICTORIA_LOGS_URL`, `DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`, `LLM_BACKEND`, `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_API_KEY`.

## Testing

Tests use mock providers (`internal/provider/mock.go`). Test files: `adapter_test.go` (telegram formatting), `engine_test.go` (diagnosis scoring), `resolver_test.go` (target resolution). Test scenarios deploy real K8s failure cases via `deploy/test-workloads/`.
